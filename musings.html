        <h3>Psychology</h3>
        <p>How do we understand the mind? It's not all about the neural connections. With our current state of technology, we need to talk to people to figure out what's going on in their brains. What psychologists can help us with is the intangible. They are crucial for diagnosis and treatment. But that doesn't mean that technological assistance, like AI, doesn't play a role. In fact, psychologists can help us determine how we should build AI - and computers in general - that works for everyone and is easily usable. To study AI, we don't just need engineers and scientists - we need psychologists and philosophers too. A multidisciplinary approach gives us a myriad of perspectives.</p>

        <p>The psychologist's perspective especially matters in cases where we're coming up with general frameworks for AI and new computers. Although the specific implementation is up to the computer scientist or engineer, the psychologist can look at how thoughts in the human mind relate and propagate, and translate these concepts into clear and novel plans for new systems.</p>

        <p>Why is this important? Psychologists add the human touch and ensure that the systems, in addition to being technologically sound, make sense to humans and, as closely as possible, mirror human thought patterns. After all, we're developing AI to help us - so it makes sense that AI should act and think much like we do.</p>

        <p>How can I gain a greater understanding of AI principles with little or no programming/engineering experience? There's many easy-to-use tools and resources that let you jump straight into experiencing AI. Here's a general overview of various AI resources by Yann LeCun. Want a simple yet powerful programming environment to play with AI? Check out OpenAI.</p>

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Some of you have probably read H.G. Wells' classic, The Island of Dr. Moreau. Among other things, it's a great commentary on the philosophy of surgery. Why do we do surgery? To treat ailments, or to push the boundaries of human grasp over nature?</p>

        <p>Wait, isn't that second one basically Frankenstein? It is, sort of. But using surgery to create new permutations of life was actually something that French vivisectionists looked at with animals in the 19th century. Check out my recent article on the subject for more on that.</p>

        <p>Why is this important? Don't we have animal rights now? We do - but now, experimental surgery is less vain experimentation on hapless critters, and more ground-breaking work on the brain. We already have cybernetic devices that are making the lives of those with disabilities much easier. But the debate on using science for the advancement of human ability is alive and well, as we'll soon have the ability to build brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) - devices that will let us communicate more quickly and efficiently with people and devices around us. It's cool stuff, but we've got some serious ethical issues to untangle - for one, should we be selling BMIs on the open market with the promise of tangibly increased mental ability? Or should we be focusing our attention on building implants to lessen the blow of conditions like Alzheimer's or Parkinsons? Check out this great explainer from Wait But Why (one of my favourite blogs these days) for an in-depth look at just why BMIs are so revolutionary - including a special look at Elon Musk's awesome project, Neuralink ( some of what he does when he isn't landing rockets or making solar panel roofs and stuff). We aren't cyborgs just yet, but we're making progress.</p>

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>Art for art's sake - that's a great pursuit. Sometimes by throwing out our need to attach practicality to what we create, we can make amazing things. But art that also informs you is, in my view, something very special. There's a lot of ways in which art can speak to us and teach us about historical events or the world around us - Picasso's Guernica, for example, tells us a lot about the feelings people were experiencing during the Spanish Civil War. But, far more simply, art can inform us about things we encounter everyday, but things that we perhaps don't immediately recognize as aesthetically pleasing. I speak of infographics - attractively designed charts that highlight connections among related items. These items can be subway stations (metro maps are infographics!), data about what kinds of food people like to eat in a given area, or pretty much anything that we encounter everyday but don't often appreciate at scale. For example, some of us ride the bus or train everyday without appreciating the design language that can unite a whole fleet of buses and trains (and more) spanning two decades. And yet that's exactly what Peter Dovak highlights in his brilliant art of transit fleets around the US and Canada. There's lots to see here, beyond transit fleets (he also made this great visualization of the rocketlike growth of China's subway systems). And yes, people buy prints and hang this stuff up on their walls - it's art, with an informative purpose!</p>
