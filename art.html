        <p>Art for art's sake - that's a great pursuit. Sometimes by throwing out our need to attach practicality to what we create, we can make amazing things. But art that also informs you is, in my view, something very special. There are a lot of ways in which art can speak to us and teach us about historical events or the world around us - Picasso's Guernica, for example, tells us a lot about the feelings people were experiencing during the Spanish Civil War. But, far more simply, art can inform us about things we encounter every day, but things that we perhaps don't immediately recognize as aesthetically pleasing. I speak of infographics - attractively designed charts that highlight connections among related items. These items can be subway stations (metro maps are infographics!), data about what kinds of food people like to eat in a given area, or pretty much anything that we encounter every day but don't often fully appreciate. For example, some of us ride the bus or train every day without appreciating the design language that can unite a whole fleet of buses and trains (and more) spanning two decades. And yet that's exactly what Peter Dovak highlights in his brilliant art of transit fleets around the US and Canada. There's lots to see here, beyond transit fleets (he also made this great visualization of the rocketlike growth of China's subway systems). And yes, people buy prints and hang this stuff up on their walls - it's art, with an informative purpose!</p>
