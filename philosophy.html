        <p>Some of you have probably read H.G. Wells' classic, The Island of Dr. Moreau. Among other things, it's a great commentary on the philosophy of surgery. Why do we do surgery? To treat ailments, or to push the boundaries of human grasp over nature?</p>

        <p>Wait, isn't that second one basically Frankenstein? It is, sort of. But using surgery to create new permutations of life was actually something that French vivisectionists looked at with animals in the 19th century. Check out my recent article on the subject for more on that.</p>

        <p>Why is this important? Don't we have animal rights now? We do - but now, experimental surgery is less vain experimentation on hapless critters, and more ground-breaking work on the brain. We already have cybernetic devices that are making the lives of those with disabilities much easier. But the debate on using science for the advancement of human ability is alive and well, as we'll soon have the ability to build brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) - devices that will let us communicate more quickly and efficiently with people and devices around us. It's cool stuff, but we've got some serious ethical issues to untangle - for one, should we be selling BMIs on the open market with the promise of tangibly increased mental ability? Or should we be focusing our attention on building implants to lessen the blow of conditions like Alzheimer's or Parkinsons? Check out this great explainer from Wait But Why (one of my favourite blogs these days) for an in-depth look at just why BMIs are so revolutionary - including a special look at Elon Musk's awesome project, Neuralink ( some of what he does when he isn't landing rockets or making solar panel roofs and stuff). We aren't cyborgs just yet, but we're making progress.</p>
