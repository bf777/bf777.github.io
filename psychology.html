    <p>How do we understand the mind? It's not all about the neural connections. With our current state of technology, we need to talk to people to figure out what's going on in their brains. What psychologists can help us with is the intangible. They are crucial for diagnosis and treatment. But that doesn't mean that technological assistance, like AI, doesn't play a role. In fact, psychologists can help us determine how we should build AI - and computers in general - that works for everyone and is easily usable. To study AI, we don't just need engineers and scientists - we need psychologists and philosophers too. A multidisciplinary approach gives us a myriad of perspectives.</p>

        <p>The psychologist's perspective especially matters in cases where we're coming up with general frameworks for AI and new computers. Although the specific implementation is up to the computer scientist or engineer, the psychologist can look at how thoughts in the human mind relate and propagate, and translate these concepts into clear and novel plans for new systems.</p>

        <p>Why is this important? Psychologists add the human touch and ensure that the systems, in addition to being technologically sound, make sense to humans and, as closely as possible, mirror human thought patterns. After all, we're developing AI to help us - so it makes sense that AI should act and think much like we do.</p>

        <p>How can I gain a greater understanding of AI principles with little or no programming/engineering experience? There are many easy-to-use tools and resources that let you jump straight into experiencing AI. Here's a general overview of various AI resources by Yann LeCun.
